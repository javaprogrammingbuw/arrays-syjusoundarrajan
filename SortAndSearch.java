	//todo: Write a method bubbleSrt which gets an integer array as input and which sorts this array according to the bubblesort algorithm
	//If you don't know how bubblesort works you can read it here: http://www.pkirs.utep.edu/CIS3355/Tutorials/chapter9/tutorial9A/bubblesort.htm
	//Now write another method binSrch. This method again receives an integer array as input together with another integer n.
	//First, it sorts this array by using the bubblSrt method. Then, it searches for n.
	//You can look up the binary search algorithm here: https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/binary-search/a/binary-search

	// NOTE: implementation missing
